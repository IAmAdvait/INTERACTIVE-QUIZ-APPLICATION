*DESCRIPTION*: This code creates a simple interactive quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app runs entirely in the browser, making it lightweight and easy to use or share. When a user opens the quiz, they see a clean, card-style interface centered on the screen. At the top, there is a progress bar that shows how far they have gone in the quiz.

Each question appears one at a time, pulled from a small set of predefined questions stored in a JavaScript array. Below the question, multiple answer options appear as buttons. When the user picks an answer, they get immediate feedback through an alert about whether they were correct. If they choose the right answer, their score goes up. After answering, the app automatically shows the next question.

The progress bar updates smoothly as the quiz progresses, giving the user a sense of momentum. Once all questions are answered, the app displays a “Quiz Completed” message along with the user’s final score out of the total number of questions. The progress bar also fills up completely to signal the end of the quiz.

In the background, JavaScript manages the logic: loading questions, checking answers, updating the score, and adjusting the progress bar width. CSS handles the styling, giving the app a clean and user-friendly look with shadows, rounded corners, and hover effects on the answer buttons. The layout uses Flexbox to center everything neatly in the browser window, ensuring it looks good on most screens.

Overall, this code provides a straightforward but solid base for a web-based quiz, and it can easily be expanded with features like timers, categories, or a backend for saving scores.
